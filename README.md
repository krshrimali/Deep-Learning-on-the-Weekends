# Neural-Networks using P5 JS
Inspired by Daniel Shiffman's The Nature of Code Tutorials. This is my work on it.  

**Repo referenced :** http://github.com/shiffman/The-Nature-of-Code-Examples-p5.js

**Points to be noted:**

1) This work is more than just inspired by Daniel. He has made significant contributions to the Open Source Society and Processing Foundation. All credits to Daniel. 

2) The code might just completely match OR "not match" (if I plan to do some changes, significant I mean.) 

3) It's not for someone's learning as of now. It's an open sourced work of mine, which I intend to on my week-ends (the week days work are in other repos, mainly of Computer Vision and Deep Learning). 

4) For ease, I'll put the things I've changed in a log file in the specific folder. **File name : changelog.txt**


**Most of the work will now be on https://www.github.com/krshrimali/Algorithms**
